# Insulae

This page is meant as a documentation of all technical aspects relating to my postdoc project on early modern German perceptions of European islands.

Topics covered will include:

* Mapping publications (using QGIS and web-mapping tools)

* Georeferencing and comparing historic maps in terms of content, style and purpose

* Distant reading / topic modelling of selected sources (especially geographic dictionaries and travel reports)

* Extracting information on relevant places from Geonames and Wikidata

* Collection biographic information (e.g. relating to cartographers and printers) from Wikidata and the German National Library (DNB)

**Python scripts** used to analyse my data are mainly shared in my separate [Digital History repository](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/DigitalHistory) and consecutively discussed in my **Doing digital history with Python series** on the [IEG DH Lab blog](https://dhlab.hypotheses.org/).
