# About the Insulae repository

This repository documents technical aspects relating to my postdoc project on early modern German perceptions of European islands.

The digital side of my project includes:

* Mapping island history and island publications (using QGIS and web-mapping tools)

a) Mapping number of publications by year and language (using overall number of search results from WORLDCAT filters)
b) Mapping German-language publications by genre and origin (original work or translation)
c) Mapping publication peaks in the context of events (e.g. discoveries, battles, catastrophes)

* Georeferencing and comparing historic maps (produced by the Homann family) in terms of content, style and purpose

* Distant reading/topic modelling of selected geographic, educational and commercial dictionaries (e.g. using full-text provided by the Bavarian State Library in Munich)

* Extracting information on relevant places and people from Wikidata and the German National Library (DNB)

**Python scripts** used to analyse my data are mainly shared in my separate [Digital History repository](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/DigitalHistory) and consecutively discussed in my **Doing digital history with Python series** on the [IEG DH Lab blog](https://dhlab.hypotheses.org/).
