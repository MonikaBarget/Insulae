The challenges of analysing island publications in several languages via metadata search results on WORLDCAT are that material comes from various libraries and is not consistently tagged, that some languages had more spelling variants and lexical variants in the early modern period than others, and that the search parametres may retrieve false negatives if words occur in several languages with different meanings.

This why an initial analysis in search results per language using different word forms and WORLDCAT search fields were carried out to identify and interpret the output deviations.

3) Deductions for the best possible QUERY STRUCTURE:

Using island terms in different languages or island names as "subjects" (su:) retrieved lower and vastly different results. The **gap between "title" and "subject" results** was greatest in **French** where the title search retrieved nearly seven times as many results, possibly because terms like "îsle de France" are very frequent in French texts of the early modern period. The comparative search in **national library catalogues** was in most languages half-way between the WORLDCAT results for "title" and "subject" searches.

"Keyword" searches (kw:) retrieved **three times as many results** as XXX searches, but here, too, the search language made a difference. Also, "keyword" searches in WORLDCAT consider all fields including publication places and does tend to retrieve too many false negatives:

<quote>Keyword, kw:, coffee or tea and house+

[keyword searches: publication year, ISBN, geographic codes, map data, and all the information found in the Author, Title, Notes, Publisher, Publisher location, and Subject indexes]</quote>

Latin books entitled **"de insulis"** can only be found via direct title search as most Latin items in WORLDCAT do not have any keywords or tags at all. 

In general, missing metadata in the catalogues of the owning libraries influence the search results. This is why the "title" search (ti:) is the most reliable option if island terms from all relevant languages are included. (ti:) and (su:) cannot be combined through "OR", which is why combined searches in title and subject lower the result output. As the statistics would be distorted if languages are counted although their island terms are NOT part of the (ti:) search, the analysis had to be limited to the **Romanesque langages as well as German, English, Dutch and Gaelic**:

'''insul+OR+insula+OR+isle+OR+insel+OR+island+OR+inseln+OR+insuln+OR+isola+oileán'''

The **Scandinavian languages** had to be selected separately because their island names could be read as invidual characters in words rather than words of their own. In addition, the **Swedish National Library Catalogue"** was manually searched for additional works.

**Slawonic languages** were widely absent in the first place and a check in the Polish national library catalogue revealed that most island works from the early modern period kept in Polish institutions are foreign language works. 

**Ottoman Turkish** works from the **Turkish National Library Catalogue** turned out to be irrelevant for the research project.
