All items analysed and mapped in this project were collected in a custom [ZOTERO](zotero.org) library.

The import of items was carried out via web automation. 

There were several issues to consider:

> I have written a Python script that automates my ZOTERO browser add-on in a personalised Google Chrome profile and allows me to add search results from WORLDCAT to a group library. Unfortunately, I will have to run several queries because of the set-up of the search engine, and this will mean that a considerable number of duplicates will be retrieved. What happens if my script tries adding an item from the very same catalogue (WORLDCAT) to a group library that already exists? Does ZOTERO spot it's the same and ignores the import? That would be good to know before I go ahead. If duplicates are added regardless, I might need to import my search results to independent sub-folders first and find a way to compare them efficiently. Or is there a way to automate the ZOTERO duplicate finder with PyZOTERO?


Duplicates were cleaned semi-manually.

Tagging was unified manually via the ZOTERO **tag selector** and **PyZotero** scripts.
