The number of publications per language were extracted from HathiTrust with Python Selenium to get a general overview of the importance of specific islands across space and time. Both mentions of an individual island and its archipelago were counted. All languages identified by HathiTrust were included in the statistics.

Problems to consider:

a) possible dublicates of entries
b) misattribution of publication languages
