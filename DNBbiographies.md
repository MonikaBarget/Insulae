DNB (German National Library) norm data are used to identify and compare the biographies and output of geographers, cartographers, printers, editors, and booksellers who contributed to printed works on European islands published in the Holy Roman Empire.

The relevant **search terms** are:

* Geograf
* Geograph
* Kartograf
* Kartograph
* Drucker
* Buchdrucker
* Verleger
* Buchh√§ndler

The search is complicated by the fact that these tags or keywords are not used consistently throughout the datasets:

a) *Geograf* (modernised German spelling) and *Geograph* (traditional German spelling) are not synonymous but retrieve different results.

b) The hierarchy of search terms such as *Drucker* and *Buchdrucker* is not clear. While one would expect *Drucker* to be a broader category than *Buchdrucker*, not all items tagged *Buchdrucker* include *Drucker*. 

Information given as part of the HTML result pages are not necessarily part of the TTL files available as a data dump. 

The German National Library has been contacted to address these issues.
